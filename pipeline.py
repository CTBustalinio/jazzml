# Description: A client Python program to implement the entire pipeline    #
# (as a demo) from MIDI parsing to music generation, calling the other     #
# modules in the neighboring directories.                                  #
# Data: Pat Metheny MIDI file, w/well-separated melody/accompaniment.      #
#                                                                          #

# Tip for development: write each part in this client program first, then
# move the code to its own module later. That way, you don't have to deal
# with any messy "can't find that var since in another module's
# function" problems, which may slow you down.

    # soloStream[-1] might start a beat too late. But maybe it doesn't 
    # matter if you're going to take every 4 anyway - as long as it plays
    # okay!). Then start working on the algorithm, measure by measure.
